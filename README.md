# Data-Structures

This report is a readme for the data structures assignment.
I have not used any built-in function in any of the codes.
Instructions for each question is given below
1)	The string is case sensitive, It accepts only uppercase letters.
the allowed functions are
Store
Print
Ascend (or) Sort
Remove n   (here n is a number)

2)after giving the numbers press enter and give
M – min max
C – ancestor
S – successor
P – predecessor

3)After giving all the edges press one extra enter which will indicate the code that there are no more edges and the next input can be 
neighbors n  (n is a number)
vertices
edgeWeight n m (n ,m are numbers)
containsVertes n 
containsEdge n m

4)after all the edges give an extra enter to show edges are over after that 
Find -  will print all the connected components
SP n – will give shortest distance from n to all its connected paths lengths(Dijkstraws)

5)This will give all the edges of the minimum spanning tree
No other inputs other than the edges.
And give an error “wrong input as it has more than one connected component ” when there is no spanning tree possible.
